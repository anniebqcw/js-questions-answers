title: What is the difference between null, undefined and undeclared?
---

- `Null`: The absence of an object or value, it does not exist.
- `Undefined`: The variable has not been assigned a variable or is not declared at all.
- `Undeclared`: Variables that have been declared without using `const`, `var`, or `let`.
