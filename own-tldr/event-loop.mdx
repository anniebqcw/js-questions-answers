title: What is the Event Loop in JavaScript runtime?
---

- The event loop allows JS to handle asynchronous tasks in a non-blocking way (since JS is single threaded).

## API Calls:

    1. API call added to the call stack
    2. API call moved to the Web API environment (i.e Node.js, the browser)
    3. Once completed, the result will be added to the task queue
    4. Once the call stack (and the micro task queue!) is empty, the result will be pushed back to the call stack

## Promise Calls:

    1. Promise added to the call stack (declaration is synchronous, the operation inside the promise is async)
    2. The asynchronous operation (ie setTimeout) is moved to the web api environment to run without blocking the call stack
    3. Once the asynchronous operation completes (e.g. resolved or rejected), the callback function (e.g. then or catch) is added to the microtask queue
    4. Once the call stack is empty, the callback function is pushed to the call stack and executed
