title: What is code coverage and how can it be used to assess test quality?
---

- Code coverage is a metric used to determine the percentage of code executed when tests are run.
- There are different types of coverage to assess the different types of code: `function`, `statements` (I.e. if statements), `branches` (I.e. all branches of a decision have been executed), `condition` (whether each condition is evaluated to both true and false), `line` (how many lines of code).

## Code Coverage & Code Quality

- Can identify gaps in testing, such as variety of outcomes (edge cases)
- Can highlight areas of code that are not tested (so tests can be implemented and increase code resilience)
