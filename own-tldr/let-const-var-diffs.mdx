title: What are the differences between JS variables declared with the keywords let, const and var?
---

## Scope:

    * `var`: scoped to the function they are created in, or if outside a function, globally scoped.
    * `let` and `const`: block scoped (to the function, if/else block etc).

## Initialisation:

    * `const`: must be initialised with a value
    * `let` and `var`: can be initialised without a value

## Redeclaration:

    * `var`: can be redeclared
    * `let` and `const`: cannot be redeclared (will throw an error)

## Reassignment:

    * `let` and `var`: can be reassigned
    * `const`: cannot be reassigned

## Accessing before declaration:

    * `let`, `var` and `const` are all hoisted
    * Accessing `let` or `const` variables before their declaration will throw a ReferenceError
    * `var` variables are auto-initialised with undefined when they are hoisted
