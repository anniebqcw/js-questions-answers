title: What is hoisting in JavaScript?
---

The term `hoisting` explains the perceived behaviour of "moving up" variable and function declarations to the top of their scope during compilation. (The JS engine becomes aware of the variable and function declarations in the scope at compilation, they are not actually moved up).

## Functions

Both the declaration and the definition of functions defined using the `function` keyword are hoisted to the top of the script when compiled.

## Variables

Variables using the `var` keyword are hoisted to the top of the page, but just the declaration (the definition is `undefined`).
